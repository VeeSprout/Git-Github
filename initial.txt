# i forked the repository from 'https://github.com/VeeSprout/Git-Github.git and cloned it on my local machine
# Then i created a branch of the main repo with my full name "Emeka Ezeh" using the branched command
# using the checkout command i navigated to the new branch created 
# in the new branch i updated the mine.py file with full name and email address.
# i saved the file and move it to the stage=ing area with the "add" command. 
# i commit the file with a meaningful measage .
# Using the Push command , i push the branch "Emeka Ezeh" to the remote repository.
# Then i checked out to the main branch to merge the "main" and "use-your-full-name" branches
# with the "git merge" command i performed a fast-forward merging of both branches without any conflit
# Then i used the push command to publish my local commits to the remote rpository.
