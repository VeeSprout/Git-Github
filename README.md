# Git-Github

 Clone the git repo
I forked the intial repo and then cloned it on my remote work station
I then created a branch with my name 
I debugged the .py file by putting my email and address after which i made the commit
I then pushed the branch to the repository after which i merged the branch to the main branch
To update both files on the branch and master, i used a pull request, there was no conflict noticed, chnages were then commited and the final changes were oused to the main files
