# Git-Github
hi
I attempted this assignment several times.
At first i didn't create a folder that includes the mine.py file.
so add a branch or commiting a barnch was really confusing from the start.
So after several mistakes, i had to delte everything and start from the begining
I created a folder on my desktop interface and named it "git assignment"
and i used git bash to open it and started with cloning the link provided in the assignment.
i cloned successfully, cd into "Git-Github"
created a branch
switched to the branch
then wrote git remote add origin "the link that was provided"
then wrote code. and it automatically opened the mine.py file with the code editor, i made the changes and saved
then back to the command prompt 
i typed git add .
git commit -m "changes made"
git push origin "branchname"
it automatically sihned in to my github account but it wasn't accepted so i had to fork the repo of Git-Github.git and i made my copy.
After that i repeate dthe processes above and pushed it and it worked.
so i had to compare and pull the request with that of the main branch on github.
it was a good experience for me because i haven't gone through this before. And i found it very fulfilling too.
