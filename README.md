# Git-Github
hello! This task wasn't an easy one, just too much of information. Firstly, I forked the provided link to my repo and I cloned it with SSH, afterwards, i created a new branch, fixed the bug and then commit. I checkout to the main branch, pull new changes that could have happen, then i merged the new branch into it and i pushed it to my repo. voila!
