# Git-Github
i first forked the repository as cloning it wasnt working, I then created a new branch named oladavies-oluwatoosin, I then fixed the bug by adding my name and email, I then commited the changes with a commit message and pushed to the oladavies oluwatoosin branch.
I then merged the oladavies-oluwatoosin branch to the main branch and commited and pushed the changes to the main branch
I then updated the readme documentation
