### Task 1 
---
*️⃣ I forked the repository, because it won't be possible to clone the reposiory and also have access to push into the repo. After the forked, I cloned it ```git clone git@github.com:maxton4life/Git-Github.git```


### Task 2
---
*️⃣ I created a new branch **Hameed-Kareem** and checked out the branch ```git checkout -b Hameed-Kareem```

*️⃣ I make the neccesary changes to fix the code **(To fix the bug you are to replace the name = "PUT YOUR NAME  and email = 'PUT YOUR EMAIL' in the mine.py file with your full name and email address).** by replacing the Name and Email strings with my name on the file.

*️⃣ I add it to the staging area and also committed it to the checked-out branch.


### Task 3
---
*️⃣ I ensure that the ```main``` branch is up to date by merging the ```Hameed-Kareem``` branch to it after pushing the code to the branch created, I then checked back to the main branch.

*️⃣ After merging it, I went to github to make a ```PR``` request on my cloned repository of the forked repository. This is important for tracking changes of the forked repository into the ```origin/main``` branch of the forked repository.
 
### Task4
---
*️⃣ I updated the ```README.md``` file with detailed information about how I fixed the bug and also commited it to the created branch on my cloned repository.

*️⃣ I checked back into the ```main``` branch to merge the created branch changes to it.
