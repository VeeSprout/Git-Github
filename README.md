# Git-Github
# I forked the repository from 'https://github.com/VeeSprout/Git-Github.git and cloned it on my local machine
# Then I created a branch of the main repo with my full name "emeka-ezeh" using the branch command
# using the checkout command I navigated to the new branch created 
# In the new branch I updated the mine.py file with my full name and email address.
# I saved the file and move it to the staging area with the "add" command. 
# I commit the file with a meaningful measage .
# Using the Push command , I push the branch "Emeka Ezeh" to the remote repository.
# Then I checked out to the main branch to merge the "main" and "emeka-ezeh" branches
# with the "git merge" command I performed a fast-forward merging of both branches without any conflit
# Then I used the push command to publish my local commits to the remote repository.
